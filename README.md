# Info
If you're a game developer who prefers not to have your games on random game-site platforms and your game is on Railin', but you don't want it there, please don't take down the [game files](https://github.com/RailinGames/files) repository or this repository. Instead, send me an email at cartxrr@proton.me with proof of ownership, and I'll remove it as quickly as possible!

Railin' is powered by [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet), and [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/).
Icons from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/).

Railin' is Running off of an older version of ultraviolet because this was built before v3 so expect errors.

Railin' v3 will **NOT** work with GitHub Pages. If you want to use GitHub Pages use [Railin' v2](https://github.com/Hypverr/Railin/tree/278fc2ffd1097e1cb9869843077c286fbcc624b3).
